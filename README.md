 ### Introduction


The GenAI Document Generation Bot is an AI-powered tool designed to automate document
creation for customer service applications. The bot generates various types of documents—
such as reports, summaries, and letters—based on user inputs, leveraging natural language
generation (NLG) techniques. This project aims to develop a functional prototype for
generating customized documents by using pre-defined templates, external data sources (such
as customer service FAQs and product manuals), and a fine-tuned language model. The bot is
designed to provide users with an intuitive interface to specify the document type, provide input
details, and automatically generate corresponding documents in a user-friendly format.


Version 5.2: Allows users to upload their own template file for document generation. It also improves processing speed by using the Gemini API and HuggingFace, overcoming previous performance issues. It uses a knowledge base from company PDFs and web pages.

Version 6: Users can select the document type, and the bot automatically uses the appropriate template. No template upload is required. This version too include the performance improvements from Gemini and HuggingFace.
